Project Base Template for Kubernetes-based Projects

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with this template, here's a list of recommended next steps.

## Where do you find what?

- `.gitlab-ci.yaml`: The deployment pipeline composed of `prepare`, `build` and `deployment` stages.
- `deploy/`: K8s manifest files that deploy an nginx server and a self-hosted Hello World Flask App.
- `helloworld/`: A simple Hello World Python App (Flask-based). Take this as a base camp for own projects.
